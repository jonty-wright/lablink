Creatinine 55 umol/L 49 - 90 eGFR (MDRD formula) >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 eGFR (CKD-EPI formula) 102 mL/min/1.73 m2

MDRD-derived estimation of GFR may significantly underestimate true GFR in patients with GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m^2. It may also be unreliable in the case of: age <18 years or >70 years; pregnancy; serious co-morbid conditions; acute renal failure; extremes of body habitus/unusual diet; gross oedema. The MDRD-eGFR used here does not employ an ethnic factor for race. Estimation of the GFR using the CKD-EPI formula is more accurate than the MDRD formula at GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, and can therefore be used to detect patients with mild renal impairment. It can be used to grade severity of renal impairment using the KDIGO 2012 recommendations. The CKD-EPI formula used here does not employ a correction factor for race.

Comment: The absence of HBsAb indicates susceptibility to HBV infection.
If HBsAg is negative, a full course of HBV vaccination is recommended. 6 weeks after the last dose of vaccine, please repeat HbsAb testing (please provide previous specimen number).

Please contact the laboratory for advice in the case of failure to seroconvert to vaccine.

If the patient has completed a full course of HBV vaccine in the last 5 years, then: a) HBV infection should be excluded by HBsAg testing b) If HBsAg is negative, use Hepatitis B immunoglobulin in situations requiring post-exposure prophylaxis.

Hepatitis C Antibody: Total Ab Result Negative

Comment: The absence of HCV antibodies suggests no past or current HCV infection, although a negative result does not entirely exclude the possibility of HCV infection since HCV antibodies may be undetectable in certain stages of the infection and in certain clinical conditions.
NOTE: Hepatitis C seroconversion is often delayed and may take up to 15 weeks to become positive following infection.

Test automatically rejected on the basis of the hospital's electronic gatekeeping rules. If it is clinically necessary for the test to be performed, the rejection can only be reversed by providing a valid approval number to the laboratory. This must be done within 7 days, and before the stability limits of the test are exceeded. Please contact the person designated to provide eGK approval numbers for your facility.

Red Cell Morphology: Anisocytosis. Moderate polychromasia. Scanty nucleated RBC's observed. No overt red cell fragmentation. No spherocytosis.
White Cell Morphology: Absolute neutrophilic leucocytosis. Toxic granulation. Left shift to the myelocyte stage. Pleomorphic lymphocyte population. No blasts seen on scanning.

Platelet Morphology: Normal granular morphology.

Blood Smear comment: A leucoerythroblastic reaction is noted. This may be secondary to haemolysis or severe underlying infection. Other possible causes for a leucoerythroblastic reaction include marrow infiltration by metastatic malignancies and haematologic malignancies. A complete septic and haemolytic screen (Coombs test, LDH, reticulocyte count, unconjugated bilirubin and haptoglobin) is indicated.

Comment: The presence of Rubella IgG suggests that this patient has had past infection and has immunity to Rubella.
If clinical Rubella infection is suspected in a patient who is less than 20 weeks pregnant, please request Rubella IgM urgently. Avidity testing can be performed if IgG is positive to determine the risk to the foetus (to differentiate primary infection from re-infection).

HIV-1/2 Rapid (Screen): HIV-1/2 Rapid Result Negative

Comment: A negative result does not completely rule out the possibility of an infection with HIV, e.g., patients in the HIV "Window Period". Note: Children who have been on treatment from an early stage of infection may be antibody negative.
NOTE: the sensitivity and specificity of this Rapid Test is less than that of standard HIV ELISA's.

Please interpret results in the context of clinical findings and other investigations and/or laboratory results. Please repeat sample if clinically indicated.

Interpretation:

Neutrophilia suggestive of a reactive process. Please exclude infection. No blasts noted. No red cell fragmentation. True thrombocytopenia. The marked thrombocytopenia may be due to immune mediated peripheral platelet destruction (idiopathic or secondary to viral infections, HIV, drugs and autoimmune disorders). Other possible causes include sequestration(e.g. hypersplenism) and platelet consumption (if considered, a DIC screen is advised) and decreased platelet production.
